All, his mother Claire Mumford believes, thanks to home-schooling. “It’s not that I’m anti-establishment,” says Mumford, who has been home-schooling Ben and her other children, Sam, 11, and Amelia, eight, for the last year. “It’s just that schools haven’t got the time to nurture and teach children the way I think they should. School is very oppressive for young people.

In practical terms, the surest way to eat better is cooking most of your food at home or, failing that, talking some other nice person into doing it for you. The more you eat out or rely on convenience food, the more the balance of your diet will go the wrong way. The more food you eat that isn’t homemade, the poorer your diet is likely to be in terms of nutrition and the quality and provenance of its ingredients. If you base your meals on mainly unprocessed or minimally processed ingredients, and cook more often than not, you won’t go far wrong."

Health care providers can help.,"As the school year comes to a close, I can’t help but think of the fact that one in four kids in Philadelphia don’t get the food that they need to lead a healthy, active life. How is it that in a country of wealth and excess, many of children’s basic life needs are not being met? Medical visits for hunger-related complaints have two major peaks: in the depth of winter and when school is out of session. As a pediatrician in the emergency department, I see this hunger present as belly pain quickly cured by a sandwich; poorly controlled diabetes because of inexpensive calorie-dense, nutrient-poor food; and in severe cases, even seizures in babies because of watered-down formula. When society fails these kids, it becomes the health care system’s responsibility not only to address health concerns, but also to help improve the family’s resources."

This is a serious issue – children require good nutrition for optimal growth and development, readiness to learn and school performance.

Unavailability food, poor purchasing power, illiteracy, unemployment, population explosion, gender bias, poor environmental conditions, lack of political will and commitment, poor communication, monitoring and distribution system are some of the factors that hamper hunger prevention and food insecurity in majority of the nations. Food, shelter and clothing are the fundamental rights of every citizen of every nation. With the threats of religious disharmony, rising violence, natural disaster and the lack of will of philanthropists are issues that need to be addressed. FAO ongoing project and hunger prevention program need to have that human touch that looks at giving dignity to every human being irrespective caste, creed and community. There is a special need of taking care of large refugee communities because of civil war that destroy nations that want power not solution to human well-being. Proxy war waged by developed nations if they could sit and seriously think that how they could help humanity with this pressing problem of food insecurity can provide semblance of a solution to such problems."

""I don't know the feeling of (having) grown up in a rich family -- but I will ask my kids,"" read a slogan on one of the blackboards in the More high school in Tlhabologang township. ""Twenty five years ago, we were voting for freedom,"" said black civil servant, Mpho Nonyane, 33."
